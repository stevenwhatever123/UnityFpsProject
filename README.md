This is my attemp on using Unity Engine for the first time.

I decided to create a FPS game as I tried to figure out 
the basic mechanics and knowledge of using the engine first

This is the menu of my game which I took the logo and copy the style of FINAL FANTASY XIII-2.
I really like the intro of it but I always feel like the intro could do better by matching to its music.
So I tried recreate it but it looks good but I think I could do better on it.
